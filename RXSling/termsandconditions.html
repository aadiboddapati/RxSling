        <li> (2.5)We do not enforce any policy for Your Account password. However, depending upon the importance of Your usage, We request You to set a stronger password containing a combination of alphanumeric and special characters to ensure maximum protection for Your account.</li>
        <li> (2.6) You cannot edit Your mobile number and email ID once You complete Your registration on the App. If You change Your mobile number or email ID, it is important that You delete Your existing My Show & Tell account and register for a new account.</li>

If You forget Your email ID or provide a wrong/invalid email ID, You may even have to delete Your existing My Show & Tell account and re-register for a new one.</li>
        <li> (2.8) Once You log on to the App, Your session will remain live on Your mobile until You sign out manually. In any unfortunate event of losing Your mobile (theft), there is a fair chance for someone else to access Your My Show & Tell account from Your lost mobile.

Besides, You may also choose to change Your password for additional security.</li>

        <li> (2.14) You are responsible for the content You post. The consequence of any violation with respect to Your content will be borne by You. Please note that We reserve the rights to remove any abusive, unsocial, objectionable, or inappropriate content,  including hashtags, with or without notice.</li>
        <li> (2.15) As a viewer, if You notice any abusive, unsocial, objectionable, or inappropriate content or any copyright violations, You can report it by tapping the ‘i’ icon on the top-right corner of every Show & Tell content while it plays and then tapping the ‘Report Abuse’ button. Upon receipt of Your complaint, We will evaluate Your request, determine its severity, and perform appropriate action in no more than 24 hours.</li>
       	<li> (2.16) As a viewer, if you notice any abusive, unsocial, objectionable, or inappropriate content being posted by a user consistently, you can block that user by tapping the ‘i’ icon on the top-right corner of any of the user’s Show & Tell content while it plays and then tapping the ‘Block User’ button. Upon blocking a user, you will not see any content from that user on your Stage while you will see the user name listed under the ‘Blocked Users’ list, accessible from the side menu. You can unblock any user from the ‘Blocked Users’ list anytime as you wish.</li>
        <li> (2.17) Our inbuilt algorithm will use Your content title, content description, search keyword, and/or transcript of Your audio/video note to sort and identify the right content to provide better user experience for You.</li>
        <li> (2.18) All the contents in the App are public contents by default. Public content is the content that is accessible through an open URL. However, Your public contents are not listed and classified on the Stage unless You enable that option. If You want Us to treat Your content as private, You may secure Your content with a PIN under the Optional Settings in the Save & Share screen of Your Show & Tell content. However, You must remember to share the PIN with Your intended user(s) for them to access Your content.</li>
        <li> (2.19) We prioritize the listing of the Show & Tell contents on the Stage based on certain internal algorithms, such as the latest-content-on-top approach and search keywords used by App users, as well as in agreement with the interests of Our business stakeholders and affiliates.</li>
        <li> (2.20) We reserve the rights to modify the classification of Your Show & Tell contents if We find that they are incorrectly mapped or for any other reasons declared valid by Us.</li>
        <li> (2.21) Currently, the App and all its algorithms support English language. However, if Your device allows You to type in any other languages, We will attempt to support that using UTF-16.</li>
        <li> (2.22) We have developed and tested the App on all common devices and browsers and have ascertained it to work in all of those scenarios without any glitch. However, We are not responsible if the App does not work on any specific or peculiar scenario or cause any damage to the software or the hardware of any specific device.</li>
        <li> (2.23) To know more about any latest addition (features) to the App, You may check the FAQ section on the App menu.</li>
        <li> (2.24) You acknowledge that We compress Your images, audios, and videos to fit into a bandwidth to ensure ease of use. Based on the quality of Your files, this activity may sometimes lead to a reduction in clarity of Your images, videos, or audios. Nevertheless, We are working to ensure the best viewing experience for Our users all the time. You also acknowledge that We crop Your images to fit into the preview templates in the App, which after cropping may look inappropriate in the preview. This is purely inadvertent and You agree to not hold Us responsible for the same.</li>
        <li> (2.25) The minimum mandate to create Your Show & Tell content is the image(s) that You want to show, a video or audio note describing Your images, and an appropriate title for Your Show & Tell content.</li>
        <li> (2.26) If You do not set a picture specifically for Your Show & Tell content, the App generates Your Show & Tell content using the picture available in Your account profile. If You set a content-specific picture, Your Show & Tell content displays that picture and the information ‘i’ screen (that opens when You tap the ‘i’ in the top-right corner of Your Show & Tell content when it plays) displays the picture of Your account profile.</li>
        <li> (2.27) If You want to protect Your identity, You may always choose to describe Your shared images through an audio recording instead of a video recording. You may also choose to remove Your profile picture or replace Your profile picture with any other generic picture if You do not want the audio snippet to display Your profile picture on it. Nevertheless, You acknowledge that We cannot mask Your First and Last Names on the content You share.</li>
        <li> (2.28) A Call-to-Action feature in the App enables You as a User to embed a Learn More, Buy Now, View, or Launch button on Your content to direct the viewer of Your content to a third party site. This is entirely configured by You as a User in the App. Your viewers who are tapping on this button and navigating to a third party website for simply viewing further details or an e-commerce website for processing any payment are performing this action at their own risk. We as a facilitator for Your content do not endorse the quality of Your product or authorize any action that Your viewer performs on the App.</li>
        <li> (2.29) The images used for the categories in the App are sourced from a third party under the RxPrism account.</li>
        <li> (2.30) Use of Unsplash API in Our App: We have integrated Unsplash API into Our App from where Users of Our App could access the Unsplash library and pick up images to develop their Show & Tell content. We have adhered to their minimum guidelines (as follows) with adequate approvals before incorporating this feature on Our App:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="pl_27">
        <li> (i) Named the relevant menu option as ‘Browse From Unsplash’.</li>
        <li> (ii) Added the Unsplash logo in the image browse window.</li>
        <li> (iii) Displayed the Unsplash photographer’s name on every image in the browse window.</li>
